<h1>Active Directory Management and Virtual Network Infrastructure</h1> <h2>Description</h2> This project showcases the design and deployment of a secure and efficient virtual network infrastructure utilizing **Windows Server** and **Active Directory (AD)**. The setup integrates **Domain Controllers (DCs)** for user and access management, along with network services such as **DHCP** and **RAS/NAT** to enable seamless connectivity. Virtualized environments were built using **VMware/Hyper-V**, connecting client machines and servers. Key security and performance measures were implemented to ensure robust operations. <h2>Utilities and Tools Used</h2> - **Active Directory:** Managed user accounts, OUs, group policies, and permissions. - **DHCP Configuration:** Automated IP address assignments across the network. - **RAS/NAT Setup:** Enabled secure remote access and connectivity between subnets. - **Virtualization Platforms:** Utilized VMware and Hyper-V for environment setup and management. - **Network Monitoring Tools:** Diagnosed and resolved issues related to AD replication and DNS services. <h2>Environments Used</h2> - **Windows Server:** Platform for Active Directory, DHCP, and RAS/NAT configurations. - **VMware/Hyper-V:** Virtualization platforms used to deploy and manage the network infrastructure. <h2>Project Walk-through:</h2> <p align="center"> <h3>Setting Up Active Directory:</h3> <img src="https://example.com/setup_ad.png"/><br/> <br/> <h3>Deploying DHCP:</h3> <img src="https://example.com/deploy_dhcp.png"/><br/> <br/> <h3>Configuring RAS/NAT:</h3> <img src="https://example.com/configure_ras_nat.png"/><br/> <br/> <h3>Integrating Virtual Machines:</h3> <img src="https://example.com/integrate_vms.png"/><br/> <br/> <h3>Final Network Overview:</h3> <img src="https://example.com/final_network.png"/><br/> <br/> </p>
