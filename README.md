<h1>Active Directory Management and Virtual Network Infrastructure</h1> 

<h2>Description</h2> 
This project showcases the design and deployment of a secure and efficient virtual network infrastructure utilizing Windows Server and Active Directory (AD). The setup integrates Domain Controllers (DCs) for user and access management, along with network services such as DHCP and RAS/NAT to enable seamless connectivity. Virtualized environments were built using VMware/Hyper-V, connecting client machines and servers. Key security and performance measures were implemented to ensure robust operations. 

<h2>Utilities and Tools Used</h2>
<p> - Active Directory: Managed user accounts, OUs, group policies, and permissions.</p>
<p> - DHCP Configuration: Automated IP address assignments across the network.</p>
<p> - RAS/NAT Setup: Enabled secure remote access and connectivity between subnets.</p>
<p> - Virtualization Platforms: Utilized VMware and Hyper-V for environment setup and management.</p>
<p> - Network Monitoring Tools: Diagnosed and resolved issues related to AD replication and DNS services.</p>

<h2>Environments Used</h2> 
<p> - Windows Server: Platform for Active Directory, DHCP, and RAS/NAT configurations. </p> 
<p> - VMware/Hyper-V: Virtualization platforms used to deploy and manage the network infrastructure. </p>
